:::info example description

Use the silent submission strategy, submit and respond immediately, greatly reducing the impact of network fluctuations, so that your application is still very smooth even when the network is unstable or even disconnected.

_Operation guidance:_

1. Operate the setting item, it will generate feedback immediately without waiting for the server to respond;
2. Switch the request mode and network status to experience the difference between them;
