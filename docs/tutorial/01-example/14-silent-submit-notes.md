:::info example description

A simple list implemented using the silent submission strategy, which responds immediately after submission, greatly reduces the impact of network fluctuations, allowing your application to remain very smooth even when the network is unstable or even disconnected.

_Operation guidance:_

1. Add, edit, and delete notes, it will generate feedback immediately without waiting for the server to respond;
2. Switch the request mode and network status to experience the difference between them;
