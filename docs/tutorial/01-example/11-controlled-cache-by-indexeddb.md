:::info example description

Using controlled cache allows developers to customize and manage the cache. Under the large file cache, it can cooperate with IndexedDB to manage the local cache.

_Operation guidance:_

1. Select one of the pictures, the picture will request the network to load first, and the picture data will be saved in the local IndexedDB;
2. Refresh the page and select the same picture again, the picture will get data from IndexedDB instead of initiating a network request;
